# implify
Scan a photo of the nutritional labelling and it'll be translated and fitted to your personal dietary needs!

# Research
This project is hugely researched based and all research info about what's on the USDA nutrition label standards and what the different types of words on the nutritional packages mean and how you can eat to your desires with being in full control of what you're eating
(All research will be written in the Research Folder, it might possibly be put on the github website if there is a need, which hopefully will come sometime soon
